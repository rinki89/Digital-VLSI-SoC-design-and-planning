Background
==========

SKY130 is a mature 180nm-130nm hybrid technology developed by Cypress Semiconductor that has been used for many production parts. SKY130 is now available as a foundry technology through SkyWater Technology Foundry.

The technology is the 8th generation SONOS technology node (130nm).

The technology stack consists of;

- 5 levels of metal (`p` - penta)
- Inductor or Inductor-Capable (`i`)
- Poly resistor (`r`)
- SONOS shrunken cell (`s`)
- Supports 10V regulated supply (`10R`)
