,General (RES.-),
.X,Parasitic resistance is not extrated under a sheet layer with it's corresponding res.id layer.,
,,
,Sheet Resistance (SR.-),
.X,Calibre now extracts deltaW by bucketing the sheet rho based on different widths.,The accuracy of each bucket must be within 2% of the Sheet Rho Calc using deltaW.
.met3,Parasitic resistance is calculated for all metal3 (if metal3 exists for the specific technology),
.met2,Parasitic resistance is calculated for all metal2.,
.met1,Parasitic resistance is calculated for all metal1 with the exception of varactor which follow rule SR.xcnwvc.1,
.li1,Parasitic resistance is calculated for all li1.,
.poly.1,Parasitic resistance on gates is calculated to the center of the gate.,
.poly.2,Parasitic resistance for poly is not extracted beyond the device terminal.  The device terminal for  all devices but MOS is at the edge of the poly. Note:  This means that parasitic resistance is not extracted for poly that is part of an LVS  capacitor or LVS resistor.  The LVS capacitors have poly in the model.,
.diff.1,Parasitic resistance is not extracted for any diffusion regions.,
.diff.2,Extract NRD/NRS for MOSFETs (except extendedDrain Fets) per the equations defined in USC-206. NRD/NRS for the n-type ESD devices must include the ntap enclosed in the source/drain ndiff hole NRD/NRS for the p-type ESD devices must include the ptap enclosed in the source/drain pdiff hole.,
.xnwvc.1,Inside the Varactor device boundry (see rule PASSIVES.cnwvc.1) all layers listed in the model (m1 and below) will not have resistance extracted.,
,,
,contact-to-gate space (CT.-),
.via,All vias will have parasitic resistance extracted.,
.mcon,All mcons will have parasitic resistance extracted.,
.licon.1,All licons that are connected to Poly and not connected to the poly of the xhrpoly_X_X device should have resistance extracted.,
.licon.2,All licons that are connnected to non-precision resistors will have resistance extracted.,
.licon.3,All licons that are connected to FETs will be extracted by RCX.,
.licon.4,All licons on diff of PNP/NPN will be considered part of the device model.,
.licon.5,All licons on tap of PNP/NPN will be considered part of the device model.,
.licon.6,All licons on non-PNP tap regions will have parasitic resistance extracted.,
.hrpoly.1,"All licons and mcons that are part of the hrpoly resistor will not have parasitic resitance extracted, these contacts are in the models.",
.pwres.1,"All licons and mcons that are part of the pwell resistor will not have parasitic resitance extracted, these contacts are in the models.",
