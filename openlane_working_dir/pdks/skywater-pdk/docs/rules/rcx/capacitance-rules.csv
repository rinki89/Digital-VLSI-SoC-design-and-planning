,General (CAP.-),
.X.1,No capacitance is extracted due to contacts.  (This is a generic layout extraction tool limitation.),
,,
,MOS Devices (MOS.-),
.mos.1,area between poly and diff should not have capacitance extracted.,
.mos.2,li within .055um will not have fringing capacitance (npcon.4 = 0.055 for S8),
.mos.3,there will be no fringing caps between gates ( as capacitance is shielded by the LICON and MCON).,
.mos.4,All 20V NMOS ISO DEFETs will have the parasitic diodes included in the models.,
.mos.5,All 20V NMOS ISO DEFETs will have the parasitic diode included in the models.,This model also includes the 5th terminal Drain-Psub diode (DeepNwell - Psub).
.mos.6,All 20V PMOS DEFETs will have the parasitic DeepNwell-Psub diode included in the CAD extraction.,
.mos.7,The only 20V DEFET instance parameter that the model uses from CAD extraction is m-factor.,The model will over-write all other instance parameters from CAD extraction.

,Resistors (RES.-),
.res.1,short devices must not have capacitance calculated across the device.,
.res.2,fuse devices must have capacitance extracted.,
.res.3,poly resistors that are not the precision poly resistors (xhrpoly_X_X) must have capacitance extracted.,
.res.4,metops that are merged must have capacitance extracted.,
.res.5,parasitic resistors for diff/nwell must have the junction diode extracted.,
.res.6,Poly precision resistors must not have the poly-psub parasitic capacitance extracted (RCX should also exclude head/tail poly-psub capacitance).,
.res.7,"For Poly precision resistors xhrpoly_X_1, the device recognition layer is defined by growing the poly.rs AND rpm.dg layers 0.50 um(head/tail distance from ID layer) in all directions. Poly-Field/Diff/Well, and Poly-Poly, Poly-Li will not have capacitance extracted inside this device recognition layer.",

,Capacitors (PASSIVES.-),
.cnwvc.1,"capacitance will not be extracted for field, diff, Poly, Li, M1, M2 up to 0.465u away from device\n recognition layer (as defined in LVS table of TDR)",
.cmimc.1,"capacitance will not be extracted between M2 to field, diff, Poly, Li, M1 up to 0.14u away from device\n recognition layer (intersection of M2 overlapping CAPM that's connected to VIA2, 3-terminal MiM only)",
.crfesd.1,"capacitance will not be extracted for field, diff, Poly, Li, M1, M2 up to 0.4u away from device recognition layers (diode terminals)",
