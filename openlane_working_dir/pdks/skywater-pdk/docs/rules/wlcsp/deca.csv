(cpbo.-.-),1st polyimide (mask),,
,Function: Opens over the pad openings; Allows RDL layer to connect to top metal,,
wlcsp.1,Min cpbo diameter over bond pad passivation opening,,20.00
wlcsp.2,Min bond pad passivation opening to create cpbo,,35.00
wlcsp.3,Min enclosure of cpbo over bond pad by pad:dg,,7.50
(rdl.-),Re-distribution,,
,Function: Re-distribution layer connects the top metal from the customer to the bumps,,
x.1,"Polymer 1 via and RDL1 capture pad should be designed as large as possible. The shape can be a circle, octagon, oblong, or a square with rounded corners. The via is not required to be centered within the passivation opening. Any offset is acceptable as long as the minimum overlap design rules are met",,exempt x.3a
x.2,"Fillet or “teardrop” is required between the trace and the RDL1 UBM capture pad to reduce stress and avoid 90°or acute angles which can cause over etching. If room permits, the fillet width shall be 90% of the RDL 1 UBM capture pad diameter and set back from pad shall be the same as the trace width.",,add teardrop
x.3,"Trace width and spacing shall be made equal and maximized where possible for optimized manufacturability, reliability and improved electrical performance (minimum width and spacing shall be limited to a localized area).",,Best practice
