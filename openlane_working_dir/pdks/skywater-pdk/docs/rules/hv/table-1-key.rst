.. [#f1] Deep N-Wells, N-Wells and P-Wells cannot be used as routing layers.
.. [#f2] No hv rule checks for this device.
.. [#f3] For N+ and P+ diffusion resistors and diodes, rule hv.diff.1 (spacing to unrelated diff) needs to be checked.
.. [#f4] Need to be checked for hv.poly.1, hv.poly.2, hv.poly.3, hv.poly.4.  Needs technology approval for use of hv.X.3.
.. [#f5] The hv property is localized to the hvgate and its extensions.
.. [#f6] Interconnect and contacts propagate hv, and are hv devices internal to the CAD flow only.
.. [#f7] "N/A" implies that there are no special hv rules for these layers.
