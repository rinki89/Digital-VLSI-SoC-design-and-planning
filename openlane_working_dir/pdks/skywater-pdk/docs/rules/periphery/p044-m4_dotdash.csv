| 80-100% of 700x700 window is covered by cmm4 waffleDrop, and metX PD < 65% for same window.
| 60-80% of 700x700 window is covered by cmm4 waffleDrop, and metX PD < 60% for same window.
| 50-60% of 700x700 window is covered by cmm4 waffleDrop, and metX PD < 50% for same window.
| 40-50% of 700x700 window is covered by cmm4 waffleDrop, and metX PD < 40% for same window.
| 30-40% of 700x700 window is covered by cmm4 waffleDrop, and metX PD < 30% for same window.
