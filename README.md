## üìò Session 1 - Inception of Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK 

### üî¨ Theory
__Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs__
An integrated circuit (IC)‚Äîalso known as a microchip or chip‚Äîis a compact electronic device that houses numerous interconnected components such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors. These elements are fabricated onto a thin slice of semiconductor material, typically silicon. The chip itself is generally mounted at the center of a larger component known as a package. Electrical connections between the chip and the outer pads of the package are established using a technique called wire bonding, which employs fine wires to link internal pads to external contacts.

#### Tasks:
- ‚úÖ Run _picorv32a_ design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs  
- ‚úÖ Calculate the Flop Ratio

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

1. Run _picorv32a_ design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.<br>
   Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow and perform floorplan are as follows:<br>
-  Change directory to openlane flow directory to begin using the OpenLANE flow, first navigate to the OpenLANE working directory by running:
   `cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane`<br>
-  Once the alias is set up, simply run `docker` to start the OpenLANE Docker container.<br>
-  you can launch OpenLANE in interactive mode by running `./flow.tcl -interactive` then load the required tcl package `package require openlane 0.9`. <br>
-  Prepare the design environment for picorv32a `prep -design picorv32a`.

   __Synthesis Statistics__ :
   <p>Total number of cells = 14876</p>
   <p>Number of flip-flops (sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_2) = 1613</p>
   <p>Flop Ratio = 1613 / 14876 = 0.108429685</p>
   <p>Percentage of DFFs = 0.108429685 √ó 100 = <strong>10.84296854%</strong></p>

## üìò Session 2 - Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

### üî¨ Theory

#### Tasks:
   
- ‚úÖ Run the _picorv32a_ design floorplanning using the OpenLANE flow, and generate the necessary output files.
- ‚úÖ Calculate the die area in microns using the values from the generated floorplan DEF file:<br>
               Die¬†Area=Die¬†Width¬†(¬µm)√óDie¬†Height¬†(¬µm)
- ‚úÖ Load the generated floorplan DEF file in the Magic layout tool and explore the floorplan.
- ‚úÖ Run congestion-aware placement for the picorv32a design using the OpenLANE flow, and generate the necessary output files.
- ‚úÖ Load the generated placement DEF file in Magic and explore the placement.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

1. Run _picorv32a_ design floorplan using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.<br>
   After synthesis completes, proceed to floorplanning with commond `run_floorplan`

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day2/floorplan.png)
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day2/floorplanc.png)

2. Calculate the die area in microns from the values in the floorplan DEF file.  
   Below is a screenshot or snippet showing the relevant part of the _floorplan.def_ file:
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day2/dia%20area%20.png)
   
   __Die Area Calculation from _floorplan.def___
   <p>Unit Distance: 1000 units = 1 micron</p>
   <p>Die Dimensions (in Unit Distance):<br>
    Die Width = 660685 ‚àí 0 = 660685 units<br>
    Die Height = 671405 ‚àí 0 = 671405 units</p>
    <p>Convert to Microns:<br>
     Die Width (¬µm) = 660685 / 1000 = 660.685 ¬µm<br>
     Die Height (¬µm) = 671405 / 1000 = 671.405 ¬µm</p>
    <p>Die Area (in Square Microns):<br>
     Die Area = Width √ó Height = 660.685 √ó 671.405<br>
                               = 443,587.212425 ¬µm¬≤</p>
      
3. Load generated floorplan def in magic tool and explore the floorplan.<br>
   To see the actual layout after the flow, we have to open the magic file by adding the command <br>`magic-T/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def`

 - Equidistant placement of ports.<br>
   To select an object, click on it and then press 's' on your keyboard the object will be highlighted. <br>
   To zoom in, click the object and press 'z' and To zoom out, use Shift + z.
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day2/equdistance.png)
   
   In the above layout we can see that, input output pins are at equal distance.

## üìò Session 3 - Design library cell using Magic Layout and ngspice characterization 

### üî¨ Theory

#### Tasks:
- ‚úÖ Clone the GitHub repository that contains the custom inverter standard cell design created using the OpenLANE flow.
- ‚úÖ Open the custom inverter layout using the Magic VLSI tool and examine its structure and design.
- ‚úÖ Perform SPICE netlist extraction of the inverter from within Magic.
- ‚úÖ Modify the extracted SPICE model file to prepare it for circuit simulation and analysis.
- ‚úÖ Run post-layout simulations using ngspice to verify the functionality of the inverter.
- ‚úÖ Identify and resolve issues in the DRC (Design Rule Check) section of the older Magic technology file for the SkyWater process.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation :
1. Clone the GitHub repository that contains the custom inverter standard cell design created using the OpenLANE flow.<br>
   To clone the repository, run the command in the OpenLane terminal <br> `git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign`<br> This will create a folder named vsdstdcelldesign inside the OpenLane directory.
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/copy%20command.png)
   
   After cloning, copy the Magic tech file by running <br>`cp /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech .`<br>
   Once these steps are completed, you will find the vsdstdcelldesign folder inside the OpenLane directory, along with the required sky130A.tech file.

2. Open the custom inverter layout using the Magic VLSI tool and examine its structure and design.<br>
   Command to open custom inverter layout in magic <br> `magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag & .`

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/pwr.png)
   
   The PMOS source connection to VDD (labeled as VPWR) has been verified, and the NMOS source connection to VSS (labeled as VGND) has also been confirmed.

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/drc%20error.png)
   
4. Perform SPICE netlist extraction of the inverter from within Magic.<br>
     To perform SPICE extraction for the custom inverter layout in the Magic tkcon window, first run the command `extract all` to generate the '.ext' file from the layout.<br>
     Next, use `ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0` to enable parasitic extraction by setting both the capacitance and resistance thresholds to zero.<br>
     Finally, run `ext2spice` to convert the extracted data into a SPICE netlist.
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/extract%20spice%20.png)

   let's see what inside the spice file by commond `vim sky130_inv.spice`.
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/spiceext%20.png)
   
5. Modify the extracted SPICE model file to prepare it for circuit simulation and analysis.
   
    ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/spice%20commond.png)
   
   To set up the SPICE simulation, include the model files with _.include ./libs/pshort.lib_ and _.include ./libs/nshort.lib_.<br>
   Set VDD using `VDD VPWR 0 3.3V` and VSS accordingly.<br>
   Define the input with `Va A VGND PULSE(0V 3.3V 0 0.1ns 2ns 4ns)`. <br>
   Add the analysis commands: `.tran 1n 20n`, `.control`, `run`, `.endc`, and `.end`.

6. Run post-layout simulations using ngspice to verify the functionality of the inverter.
   
    ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/ngspice%20commond.png)

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/copyinsrc.png)

5. Edit _config.tcl_ to change lib file and add the new extra lef into the openlane flow.
  
   `set ::env(LIB_SYNTH) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib`<br>
   `set ::env(LIB_FASTEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__fast.lib`<br>
   `set ::env(LIB_SLOWEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__slow.lib`<br>
   `set ::env(LIB_TYPICAL) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib`<br>

   `set ::env(EXTRA_LEFS) [glob $::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/$::env(DESIGN_NAME)/src/*.lef]`

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/configedit.png)
   
6. Run openlane flow synthesis with newly inserted custom inverter cell.
  
   Change directory to openlane flow directory to begin using the OpenLANE flow, first navigate to the OpenLANE working directory by running:
   `cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane`<br>
-  Once the alias is set up, simply run `docker` to start the OpenLANE Docker container.<br>
-  you can launch OpenLANE in interactive mode by running `./flow.tcl -interactive` then load the required tcl package `package require openlane 0.9`. <br>
-  Prepare the design environment for picorv32a `prep -design picorv32a`.<br>
-  Adiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow<br>
   `set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]`<br>
   `add_lefs -src $lefs`<br>

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/docker.png)
   
- Now that the design is prepped run synthesis using command `run_synthesis`

  ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/synthesis%20done.png)

7. Remove/reduce the newly introduced violations with the introduction of custom inverter cell by modifying design parameters.
   
   Noting down current design values generated before modifying parameters to improve timing

   Commands to view and change parameters to improve timing and run synthesis
-  Once again we have to prep design so as to update variables<br> `prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_11-34 -overwrite`.<br>

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/1.png)

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/slack0.png)

   Comparing to previously noted run values area has increased and worst negative slack has become 0.
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/areardus.png)
   

8. Once synthesis has accepted our custom inverter we can now run floorplan and placement and verify the cell is accepted in PnR flow.<br>
   Alternative to run_floorplan Command in OpenLANE If you're encountering unexpected or unexplained errors while using the standard `run_floorplan` command.<br>
   Use the Following Commands Instead of run_floorplan:<br>
   `init_floorplan`<br>
   `place_io`<br>
   `tap_decap_or`
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/runflrplan.png)

   Now we are ready to run placement `run_placement`
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/plcment.png)

9. Do Post-Synthesis timing analysis with OpenSTA tool.
    
   With zero WNS in the improved run, we now analyze the initial synthesis run, which has multiple timing violations and was done without any optimization parameters serving as a baseline for comparison.<br>
-  To start, we navigate to the OpenLANE flow directory<br> `cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane`.<br>
-  we enter the OpenLANE Docker environment simply by running `docker`.
-  Once inside the Docker container, we launch OpenLANE in interactive mode with<br> `./flow.tcl -interactive`<br>
-  We then load the necessary OpenLANE package<br> `package require openlane 0.9`<br>
-  After loading, we prepare the design environment for picorv32a, which sets up the required files and directories<br> `prep -design picorv32a`<br>
-  If new LEF (Library Exchange Format) files were added to the design source directory, we include them using <br> `set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]`<br>
   `add_lefs -src $lefs`<br>
-  To allow cell sizing during synthesis, we update the environment variable as follows <br>`set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1`<br>
-  Finally, we initiate the synthesis process with the following command<br> `run_synthesis`

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/sta3.png)
   
   Since more fanout is causing more delay we can add parameter to reduce fanout and do synthesis again<br>
   Commands to include new lef and perform synthesis
-  Use the _prep_ command to initialize the environment for the _picorv32a design_. The _-tag_ creates a uniquely named run directory, and _-overwrite_ clears any previous run with the same tag.<br>
   `prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_16-22 -overwrite`<br>
-  Add Custom LEF Files<br>
   `set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]`<br>
   `add_lefs -src $lefs`<br>
-  Enable synthesis sizing<br> `set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1`<br>
-  Set maximum fanout <br>`set ::env(SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT) 4`<br>
-  Check the current driving cell <br>`echo $::env(SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL)`<br>
-  With the design prepped and parameters updated, initiate the synthesis step <br>`run_synthesis`

10. Make timing ECO fixes to remove all violations.<br>
    OR gate of drive strength 2 is driving 4 fanouts.<br>
    To optimize timing in the design, we first analyze the net and then replace a specific cell with a higher drive-strength OR gate (sky130_fd_sc_hd__or3_4). The following commands are used in the OpenLANE interactive session:<br>
-   Report all connections to a specific net (to understand its load and related cells)<br> `report_net -connections _11672_`<br>
-   heck the syntax for the replace_cell command<br> `help replace_cell`<br>
-   Replace a specific cell with a higher drive-strength OR gate (OR3 with drive strength 4)<br> `replace_cell _14510_ sky130_fd_sc_hd__or3_4`<br>
-   Generate a custom timing report showing net capacitance, slew, and input pins<br> `report_checks -fields {net cap slew input_pins} -digits 4`<br>

    Screenshot of replaced instance
    
    ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/or5.png)

    We began the ECO fixes with a Worst Negative Slack (WNS) of -23.9000 ns and have successfully improved it to -22.6173 ns. This reflects a timing improvement of approximately 1.2827 ns through targeted optimizations.

    
11. Replace the old netlist with the new netlist generated after timing ECO fix and implement the floorplan, placement and cts.<br>

    Commands to write verilog :
-   Check the syntax and usage of the write_verilog command <br>`help write_verilog`<br>
-   Overwrite the current synthesized netlist with the updated one <br>`write_verilog /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/16-06_16-22/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v`<br>
-   Exit OpenSTA since timing analysis is complete `exit`
    
    ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/verilogcmnd.png)

    Verified that the netlist is overwritten by checking that instance _14506_ is replaced with sky130_fd_sc_hd__or4_4
    
    ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/_14506.png)

    Although we confirmed the ECO-updated netlist is ready and can be used for PnR, we are now proceeding with the original clean design (with zero violations) to carry it forward through the backend flow. Below are the commands and steps to properly reload and process the design:<br>
-   Re-prep the design to refresh environment variables and configurations <br>`prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_16-56 -overwrite`<br>
-   Add any newly added LEF files (e.g., merged.lef) to the design <br>`set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]`<br> `add_lefs -src $lefs`<br>
-   Set synthesis strategy to use delay optimization strategy 3<br> `set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"`<br>
-   Enable synthesis cell sizing for better timing optimization<br> `set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1`<br>
-   Run synthesis on the clean design<br> `run_synthesis`<br>
-   The following steps are normally executed as part of `run_floorplan`, but can be done individually if needed:<br>`init_floorplan`<br>`place_io`<br> `tap_decap_or`<br>
-   Run placement <br>`run_placement`<br>
-   Proceed to CTS after placement is complete <br>`run_cts`<br>
-   If an error occurs related to clock tree synthesis (CTS), especially regarding missing libraries, clear the variable manually <br>`unset ::env(LIB_CTS)`

## üìò Session 5 - Final steps for RTL2GDS using tritonRoute and openSTA 
### üî¨ Theory

#### Tasks:

- ‚úÖ Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.
- ‚úÖ Perfrom detailed routing using TritonRoute.
- ‚úÖ Post-Route parasitic extraction using SPEF extractor.
- ‚úÖ Post-Route OpenSTA timing analysis with the extracted parasitics of the route.
  
### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

1. Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.<br>
   Commands to perform all necessary stages up until now:<br>
-  To start, we navigate to the OpenLANE flow directory<br> `cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane`.<br>
-  we enter the OpenLANE Docker environment simply by running `docker`.
-  Once inside the Docker container, we launch OpenLANE in interactive mode with <br>`./flow.tcl -interactive`<br>
-  We then load the necessary OpenLANE package<br> `package require openlane 0.9`<br>
-  After loading, we prepare the design environment for picorv32a, which sets up the required files and directories<br> `prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_16-56`<br>

   If you see a message saying the tag already exists, there's no need to overwrite it unless changes were made. You can verify that the design is properly loaded by checking the current DEF file using `echo $::env(CURRENT_DEF)`.<br> If the path is correct, simply continue with the next design stages without running prep again.

   As we can see, if the `echo $::env(CURRENT_DEF)` command returns _/openLANE_flow/designs/picorv32a/runs/16-06_16-56/results/cts/picorv32a.cts.def_, it indicates that the design is already at the post-CTS stage. So no need to rerun earlier steps like prep, synthesis, or placement. <br>

   You can proceed directly with the remaining flow stages, such as <br>`gen_pdn`

    Since gen_pdn is complete, it means the power distribution network has been successfully generated.

   Command to perform routing <br>
-  Check the current DEF file being used (should reflect the PDN or post-CTS stage) <br> `echo $::env(CURRENT_DEF)` <br>
-  Check the routing strategy currently in use <br> `echo $::env(ROUTING_STRATEGY)` <br>
-  Perform detailed routing using TritonRoute <br> `run_routing`

   If you've already prepared the _picorv32a design_ once before and want to run the prep command again, you need to add the _-overwrite_ option. This tells OpenLANE to reuse and update the existing run instead of showing an error. `prep -design picorv32a -tag 17-06_08-51` don‚Äôt need to use -overwrite because you're creating a new run directory. but when you using existing use -overwrite like `prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_16-56 overwrite`

3. Post-Route OpenSTA timing analysis with the extracted parasitics of the route. <br>
   The next step involves post-routing STA analysis, which requires the extraction of parasitic effects (SPEF).Since OpenLANE does not have a SPEF extraction tool, this process needs to     be done outside of OpenLANE.The resulting .spef file can be located in the routing folder under the results folder.
