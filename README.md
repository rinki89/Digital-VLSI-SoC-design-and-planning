## üìò Day 1 - Inception of Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK 

### üî¨ Theory
This section introduces the basics of open-source EDA tools, OpenLANE flow, and Sky130 PDK. It explains how open-source efforts enable VLSI enthusiasts and students to carry out industry-grade digital SoC implementation flows.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

#### Tasks:

- ‚úÖ Run `picorv32a` design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs  
- ‚úÖ Calculate the Flop Ratio

1. Run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker

# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis

# Exit from OpenLANE flow
exit

# Exit from OpenLANE flow docker sub-system
exit
