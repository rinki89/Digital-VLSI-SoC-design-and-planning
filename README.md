__Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs__ <br>
An integrated circuit (IC)‚Äîalso known as a microchip or chip‚Äîis a compact electronic device that houses numerous interconnected components such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors. These elements are fabricated onto a thin slice of semiconductor material, typically silicon. The chip itself is generally mounted at the center of a larger component known as a package. Electrical connections between the chip and the outer pads of the package are established using a technique called wire bonding, which employs fine wires to link internal pads to external contacts.<br>
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/73721ed7a5c260d724223a785130fc5d072dbb1b/Pictures/Day1/1.png) <br>

The diagram below represents a block-level overview of a Processor or System on Chip (SoC) and its various interfacing elements. It showcases the pin layout and demonstrates how peripherals like UART, I2C, and memory modules are connected to the SoC. Additionally, it highlights essential power and ground connections. In engineering terms, the combination of the processor core and its supporting components, encapsulated together, is referred to as a package. A widely used package type, especially in embedded systems like those found on Arduino boards, is the QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-leads, 48-pin) package, known for its compact design and efficient performance.

The chip itself consists of several key internal components that contribute to its overall functionality:<br>
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/73721ed7a5c260d724223a785130fc5d072dbb1b/Pictures/Day1/3.png) <br>

- __Pads__: These are the electrical contact points on the chip that enable communication between the internal circuitry and the external package. Pads are strategically placed on the silicon surface to align precisely with the package leads, allowing signals to flow in and out of the chip during operation.
- __Core__: This is the central processing section of the chip. It contains the essential digital logic elements‚Äîsuch as logic gates (AND, OR, XOR), multiplexers, and control circuits‚Äîthat perform all computational tasks. The core acts as the brain of the chip, executing instructions and handling data processing.
- __Die__: The die is the physical piece of silicon on which the entire circuit is fabricated. Sliced from a larger semiconductor wafer, each die contains the active components and can operate as a standalone functional unit. After fabrication, the die is packaged to form a complete integrated circuit ready for use in electronic systems.

__Introduction to RISC-V__ <br>
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) developed at the University of California, Berkeley, named after the fifth generation of RISC designs. Unlike proprietary ISAs, RISC-V is open-source and royalty-free, enabling widespread adoption across industry and academia. Many companies now offer RISC-V hardware, and it is supported by various open-source operating systems and software toolchains.
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/73721ed7a5c260d724223a785130fc5d072dbb1b/Pictures/Day1/4.png) <br>

The base ISA uses 32-bit fixed-length instructions, with support for variable-length extensions using 16-bit parcels. It includes 32-bit, 64-bit, and a proposed 128-bit address space (the latter still under development). Internally, the chip connects to its package via bond wires, enabling communication with external pins.

__From Software Applications to Hardware__ <br>
In a computer system, application software interacts with system software, which serves as a bridge to the hardware chip. The system software includes layers like the operating system, compiler, and assembler. The operating system handles low-level tasks such as input/output operations and memory management. The compiler translates high-level code written in languages like C, C++, or Java into hardware-specific instructions. These instructions are then converted into binary code by the assembler. Finally, this binary code is sent to the hardware, which executes the instructions and produces the desired output. The instructions act as an abstract interface between the software and hardware. <br>

__Simplified RTL2GDS flow__
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day1/6.png)

__Step 1: Synthesis__:
The RTL design (written in HDL) is synthesized into a gate-level netlist using standard cell libraries (SCL). This netlist describes the logic in terms of gates and is functionally equivalent to the RTL. Standard cells have predefined layouts used for physical implementation.

__Step 2: Floorplanning & Power Planning__:
Defines the silicon area and partitions the chip into functional blocks. I/O pads are placed, and core dimensions, pin locations, and row placements are defined.
In power planning, multiple VDD and GND nets are distributed across the chip using horizontal and vertical metal stripes (power grid). Upper metal layers, being thicker, are used to minimize resistance and electromigration issues.

__Step 3: Placement__:
Places cells from the gate-level netlist into predefined rows on the floorplan.
Global Placement: Initially places cells considering timing and congestion.
Detailed Placement: Finalizes cell positions for minimal area, routing feasibility, and better timing. Aims to reduce wirelength, via count, and power.

__Step 4: Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)__:
Distributes the clock signal to all sequential elements (e.g., flip-flops, registers) using structures like H-tree or X-tree. Goal is to minimize clock skew and latency. Tools use low-skew global routing resources for better performance.

__Step 5: Routing__:
Connects all nets physically using metal layers:
Global Routing: Plans high-level routing paths.
Detailed Routing: Implements actual wire paths using routing grids. Uses divide-and-conquer to handle complexity.
Special attention is given to clock and power/ground nets. For example, in sky130 PDK, 6 routing layers are used ‚Äî starting with a local interconnect and followed by aluminum layers.

__Step 6: Sign-Off__:
Final verification before manufacturing:
Physical Verification: Includes Design Rule Checking (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) to ensure layout correctness.
Timing Verification: Static Timing Analysis (STA) ensures that timing constraints are met across all paths.

__Introduction to OpenLANE detailed ASIC design flow__
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day1/9.png?raw=true) <br>

OpenLANE supports regression testing by running around 70 designs and comparing results to known baselines. Design for Test (DFT) steps‚Äîlike scan insertion, ATPG, fault simulation, and compaction‚Äîare performed before physical implementation using OpenROAD. The flow includes floor/power planning, tap cell and decap insertion, placement, post-placement optimization, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing. Since steps like CTS and optimization modify the netlist, functional verification using Yosys LCE ensures no logic changes. Antenna rule violations are handled by adding fake antenna diodes during placement; if violations are detected after routing, fake diodes are replaced with real ones. Static Timing Analysis (STA) is done after RC extraction (DEF2SPEF) using OpenSTA to detect timing violations. Finally, physical verification includes DRC (using Magic) and LVS (using Magic and Netgen), along with SPICE extraction for further validation.

## üìò Session 2 - Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

### üî¨ Theory
__Utilization factor and aspect ratio__ <br>
In this section, we will determine the width and height of the Core and Die, which is the initial step in the physical design process. We'll begin with a simple netlist consisting of two flip-flops connected by basic combinational logic. A netlist defines the connectivity of components in a circuit. To estimate the physical size, we rely on the dimensions of standard logic gates like AND and OR, as well as the flip-flops used.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day1/10.png?raw=true) <br>

Assuming each standard cell, including the flip-flop, occupies an area of 1 unit * 1 unit, the area per cell is 1 square unit. Using this information and the netlist structure, we can now estimate the total area required for the design on the silicon wafer. Note that here we are only concerned with the area of the logic elements‚Äînot the interconnecting wires.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day1/11.png)<br>

A die is a small, square or rectangular piece of semiconductor material‚Äîusually silicon‚Äîon which the actual circuit of a chip is fabricated. It is cut from a larger silicon wafer during the manufacturing process. Within the die, various functional sections of the chip are implemented, including one or more cores. A core is the section of the die that contains the primary logic and processing units of the design. It is where the essential computational tasks are executed, such as arithmetic operations, instruction handling, and data processing. In modern chips, especially processors, multiple cores may exist on a single die to enable parallel processing and enhance performance.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day1/12.png)<br>
the concept of the utilization factor, which is defined as:
Utilization¬†Factor = Area occupied by netlist / Total area of the core

Lets take another example for a square chip wth dimensions 4*4 sq units. We will get utilization factor= 0.25 it means out of the whole chip area only 25% area is utilized by the netlistand 75% is available for additional cells which can be use for routing in which we will have layering. Aspect ratio we get = 1 it means chip is square in shape.<br>

#### Tasks:
   
- ‚úÖ Run the _picorv32a_ design floorplanning using the OpenLANE flow, and generate the necessary output files.
- ‚úÖ Calculate the die area in microns using the values from the generated floorplan DEF file:<br>
               Die¬†Area=Die¬†Width¬†(¬µm)√óDie¬†Height¬†(¬µm)

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day2/dia%20area%20.png)
   
   __Die Area Calculation from _floorplan.def___
   <p>Unit Distance: 1000 units = 1 micron</p>
   <p>Die Dimensions (in Unit Distance):<br>
    Die Width = 660685 ‚àí 0 = 660685 units<br>
    Die Height = 671405 ‚àí 0 = 671405 units</p>
    <p>Convert to Microns:<br>
     Die Width (¬µm) = 660685 / 1000 = 660.685 ¬µm<br>
     Die Height (¬µm) = 671405 / 1000 = 671.405 ¬µm</p>
    <p>Die Area (in Square Microns):<br>
     Die Area = Width √ó Height = 660.685 √ó 671.405<br>
                               = 443,587.212425 ¬µm¬≤</p>
      
3. Load generated floorplan def in magic tool and explore the floorplan.<br>

## üìò Session 3 - Design library cell using Magic Layout and ngspice characterization 

### üî¨ Theory
__SPICE deck creation for CMOS inverter__<br>
VTC- SPICE simulations:-Here first part is to create SPICE deck, it's the connectivity information about the netlist so basically it's a netlist.It has input that are provided to the simulation and the deck points which will take the output.<br>
Component connectivity:- In this we need to define the connectivity of the substrate pin. Substrate pin tunes the threshold voltage of the PMOS and NMOS.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-1.png)<br>

Component values:- Values for the PMOS nad NMOS. We have taken the same size of both PMOS and NMOS.
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-2.png)<br>

Identify the nodes:- Node mean the points between which there is a component.These nodes are required to define the netlist.
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-3.png)<br>

Name the nodes:- Now we wiil name these nodes as Vin, Vss, Vdd, out.
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-4.png)<br>

Now we will start writing the SPICE deck. It's written like shown below<br>
- Drain- Gate- Source- Substrate
- For M1 MOSFET drain is connected to out node, gate is connected to in node, PMOS transistor substrate and Source is connected to Vdd node.
- For M2 MOSFET drain is connected to out node, gate is connected to in node, NMOS source and substrate are connected to 0.
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-5.png)<br>

__SPICE simulation lab for CMOS inverter__ <br>
Till now we have described the connectivity information about CMOS inverter now we will describe the other components connnectivity information like load capacitor, source. Let's seee the connectivity of output load capacitor.
It is connected between out and the node 0. And it's value is 10ff. Supply voltage(Vdd) which is connected between Vdd and node 0 and value of it is 2.5 , Similarly we have input voltage which is connected between Vin and node 0 and its value is 2.5.
Now we have to give the simulation commands in which we are swiping the Vin from 0 to 2.5 with the stepsize of 0.05. Because we want Vout while changing the Vin.
Final step is to model files. It has the complete description about NMOS and PMOS.
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-6.png)<br>

Now we will do the SPICE simulation for the particular values. And will get the graph.
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-7.png)<br>

Now, doing other simulation in which we change the PMOS width to 3 times of NMOS width. and after diong the simulation, we get the graph like this shown below.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-8.png)<br>

The difference between these two graphs is that in the second graph the transfer charactoristic is lies in the ecxact middle of the graph where in the first graph it is lies left from the middle of the graph.

__Switching Threshold Vm__ <br>
Both models, despite having different transistor widths, serve their own specific applications. When we compare the waveforms of these models, we observe that their shapes remain consistent regardless of the voltage levels. This consistency demonstrates the robustness of CMOS technology. Specifically, when the input voltage (Vin) is low, the output is high, and when Vin is high, the output becomes low. This fundamental behavior is preserved across CMOS inverters with varying NMOS and PMOS sizes, which is a key reason why CMOS logic is so widely used in gate design.

One important parameter that reflects the robustness of a CMOS inverter is the switching threshold (Vm) the point at which the input voltage equals the output voltage (Vin = Vout). This threshold defines the exact moment the inverter transitions between logic levels.
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-9png)<br>

In this figure, we can see that at Vm~0.9v, Vin=Vout. This point is very critical point for the CMOS because at this point there is chance that both PMOS and NMOS are turned on. If both are turned on then there are high chances of leakage current(Means current flow direcly from power to ground).
By comparing this both the graph we can understang the concept of switching thresold voltage.
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-10.png)<br>

In the graph below we can identify that the PMOS and NMOS are in which region. The direction of current flowing is different for NMOS nad PMOS.
![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/3-11png)<br>

__Static and dynamic simulation of CMOS inverter__ <br>
In a dynamic simulation, we analyze the rise and fall delays of a CMOS inverter and observe how these delays vary with the switching threshold (Vm). In this type of simulation, all parameters remain constant except for the input, which is a pulse signal. The simulation is carried out using the .tran (transient analysis) command.
A Time vs. Voltage graph is generated, from which the rise time and fall time of the inverter can be measured.

5. Modify the extracted SPICE model file to prepare it for circuit simulation and analysis.
   
    ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day3/spice%20commond.png)
   
   To set up the SPICE simulation, include the model files with _.include ./libs/pshort.lib_ and _.include ./libs/nshort.lib_.<br>
   Set VDD using `VDD VPWR 0 3.3V` and VSS accordingly.<br>
   Define the input with `Va A VGND PULSE(0V 3.3V 0 0.1ns 2ns 4ns)`. <br>
   Add the analysis commands: `.tran 1n 20n`, `.control`, `run`, `.endc`, and `.end`.

6. Run post-layout simulations using ngspice to verify the functionality of the inverter.

5. Edit _config.tcl_ to change lib file and add the new extra lef into the openlane flow.
  
   `set ::env(LIB_SYNTH) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib`<br>
   `set ::env(LIB_FASTEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__fast.lib`<br>

   `set ::env(EXTRA_LEFS) [glob $::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/$::env(DESIGN_NAME)/src/*.lef]`

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/configedit.png)
   
6. Run openlane flow synthesis with newly inserted custom inverter cell.
  
   Change directory to openlane flow directory to begin using the OpenLANE flow, first navigate to the OpenLANE working directory by running:
   `cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane`<br>
-  Once the alias is set up, simply run `docker` to start the OpenLANE Docker container.<br>
-  you can launch OpenLANE in interactive mode by running `./flow.tcl -interactive` then load the required tcl package `package require openlane 0.9`. <br>
-  Prepare the design environment for picorv32a `prep -design picorv32a`.<br>
-  Adiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow<br>
   `set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]`<br>
   `add_lefs -src $lefs`<br>

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/docker.png)
   
- Now that the design is prepped run synthesis using command `run_synthesis`

   Commands to view and change parameters to improve timing and run synthesis
-  Once again we have to prep design so as to update variables<br> `prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_11-34 -overwrite`.<br>

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/1.png)

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/slack0.png)

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/areardus.png)
   

8. Once synthesis has accepted our custom inverter we can now run floorplan and placement and verify the cell is accepted in PnR flow.<br>
   Alternative to run_floorplan Command in OpenLANE If you're encountering unexpected or unexplained errors while using the standard `run_floorplan` command.<br>
   Use the Following Commands Instead of run_floorplan:<br>
   `init_floorplan`<br>
   `place_io`<br>
   `tap_decap_or`
   
   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/runflrplan.png)

   Now we are ready to run placement `run_placement`

9. Do Post-Synthesis timing analysis with OpenSTA tool.
    
   With zero WNS in the improved run, we now analyze the initial synthesis run, which has multiple timing violations and was done without any optimization parameters serving as a baseline for comparison.<br>
-  To start, we navigate to the OpenLANE flow directory<br> `cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane`.<br>
-  we enter the OpenLANE Docker environment simply by running `docker`.
-  Once inside the Docker container, we launch OpenLANE in interactive mode with<br> `./flow.tcl -interactive`<br>
-  We then load the necessary OpenLANE package<br> `package require openlane 0.9`<br>
-  After loading, we prepare the design environment for picorv32a, which sets up the required files and directories<br> `prep -design picorv32a`<br>
-  If new LEF (Library Exchange Format) files were added to the design source directory, we include them using <br> `set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]`<br>
   `add_lefs -src $lefs`<br>
-  To allow cell sizing during synthesis, we update the environment variable as follows <br>`set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1`<br>
-  Finally, we initiate the synthesis process with the following command<br> `run_synthesis`

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/synthesis%20done.png)

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/sta3.png)
   
   Since more fanout is causing more delay we can add parameter to reduce fanout and do synthesis again<br>
   Commands to include new lef and perform synthesis
-  Use the _prep_ command to initialize the environment for the _picorv32a design_. The _-tag_ creates a uniquely named run directory, and _-overwrite_ clears any previous run with the same tag.<br>
   `prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_16-22 -overwrite`<br>
-  Add Custom LEF Files<br>
   `set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]`<br>
   `add_lefs -src $lefs`<br>
-  Enable synthesis sizing<br> `set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1`<br>
-  Set maximum fanout <br>`set ::env(SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT) 4`<br>
-  Check the current driving cell <br>`echo $::env(SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL)`<br>
-  With the design prepped and parameters updated, initiate the synthesis step <br>`run_synthesis`

10. Make timing ECO fixes to remove all violations.<br>
    OR gate of drive strength 2 is driving 4 fanouts.<br>
    To optimize timing in the design, we first analyze the net and then replace a specific cell with a higher drive-strength OR gate (sky130_fd_sc_hd__or3_4). The following commands are used in the OpenLANE interactive session:<br>
-   Report all connections to a specific net (to understand its load and related cells)<br> `report_net -connections _11672_`<br>
-   heck the syntax for the replace_cell command<br> `help replace_cell`<br>
-   Replace a specific cell with a higher drive-strength OR gate (OR3 with drive strength 4)<br> `replace_cell _14510_ sky130_fd_sc_hd__or3_4`<br>
-   Generate a custom timing report showing net capacitance, slew, and input pins<br> `report_checks -fields {net cap slew input_pins} -digits 4`<br>

    We began the ECO fixes with a Worst Negative Slack (WNS) of -23.9000 ns and have successfully improved it to -22.6173 ns. This reflects a timing improvement of approximately 1.2827 ns through targeted optimizations.

    
11. Replace the old netlist with the new netlist generated after timing ECO fix and implement the floorplan, placement and cts.<br>

    Commands to write verilog :
-   Check the syntax and usage of the write_verilog command <br>`help write_verilog`<br>
-   Overwrite the current synthesized netlist with the updated one <br>`write_verilog /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/16-06_16-22/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v`<br>
-   Exit OpenSTA since timing analysis is complete `exit`
    
    ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/verilogcmnd.png)

    Verified that the netlist is overwritten by checking that instance _14506_ is replaced with sky130_fd_sc_hd__or4_4
    
    ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day4/_14506.png)

    Although we confirmed the ECO-updated netlist is ready and can be used for PnR, we are now proceeding with the original clean design (with zero violations) to carry it forward through the backend flow. Below are the commands and steps to properly reload and process the design:<br>
-   Re-prep the design to refresh environment variables and configurations <br>`prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_16-56 -overwrite`<br>
-   Add any newly added LEF files (e.g., merged.lef) to the design <br>`set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]`<br> `add_lefs -src $lefs`<br>
-   Set synthesis strategy to use delay optimization strategy 3<br> `set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"`<br>
-   Enable synthesis cell sizing for better timing optimization<br> `set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1`<br>
-   Run synthesis on the clean design<br> `run_synthesis`<br>
-   The following steps are normally executed as part of `run_floorplan`, but can be done individually if needed:<br>`init_floorplan`<br>`place_io`<br> `tap_decap_or`<br>
-   Run placement <br>`run_placement`<br>
-   Proceed to CTS after placement is complete <br>`run_cts`<br>
-   If an error occurs related to clock tree synthesis (CTS), especially regarding missing libraries, clear the variable manually <br>`unset ::env(LIB_CTS)`

-   Load the custom constraints file (SDC)<br> `read_sdc /openLANE_flow/designs/picorv32a/src/my_base.sdc`<br>
-   Mark all clocks as propagated (to include clock tree effects)<br> `set_propagated_clock [all_clocks]`<br>
-   (Optional) Review syntax and usage of the timing report command <br>`help report_checks`<br>
-   Generate a detailed custom timing report (with min/max delay paths)<br>`report_checks -path_delay min_max -fields {slew trans net cap input_pins} -format full_clock_expanded -digits 4`<br>
-   Exit OpenROAD and return to the OpenLANE flow<br> `exit`<br>

## üìò Session 5 - Final steps for RTL2GDS using tritonRoute and openSTA 
### üî¨ Theory

#### Tasks:

- ‚úÖ Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.
- ‚úÖ Perfrom detailed routing using TritonRoute.
- ‚úÖ Post-Route parasitic extraction using SPEF extractor.
- ‚úÖ Post-Route OpenSTA timing analysis with the extracted parasitics of the route.
  
### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

1. Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.<br>
   Commands to perform all necessary stages up until now:<br>
-  To start, we navigate to the OpenLANE flow directory<br> `cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane`.<br>
-  we enter the OpenLANE Docker environment simply by running `docker`.
-  Once inside the Docker container, we launch OpenLANE in interactive mode with <br>`./flow.tcl -interactive`<br>
-  We then load the necessary OpenLANE package<br> `package require openlane 0.9`<br>
-  After loading, we prepare the design environment for picorv32a, which sets up the required files and directories<br> `prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_16-56`<br>

   If you see a message saying the tag already exists, there's no need to overwrite it unless changes were made. You can verify that the design is properly loaded by checking the current DEF file using `echo $::env(CURRENT_DEF)`.<br> If the path is correct, simply continue with the next design stages without running prep again.

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day5/1.png)

   As we can see, if the `echo $::env(CURRENT_DEF)` command returns _/openLANE_flow/designs/picorv32a/runs/16-06_16-56/results/cts/picorv32a.cts.def_, it indicates that the design is already at the post-CTS stage. So no need to rerun earlier steps like prep, synthesis, or placement. <br>

   You can proceed directly with the remaining flow stages, such as <br>`gen_pdn`

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day5/2.png)

    Since gen_pdn is complete, it means the power distribution network has been successfully generated.

    Command to load the PDN def in magic tool <br> `magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read 14-pdn.def &` <br>

2. Perfrom detailed routing using TritonRoute and explore the routed layout.

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day5/9.png)

   Command to perform routing <br>
-  Check the current DEF file being used (should reflect the PDN or post-CTS stage) <br> `echo $::env(CURRENT_DEF)` <br>
-  Check the routing strategy currently in use <br> `echo $::env(ROUTING_STRATEGY)` <br>
-  Perform detailed routing using TritonRoute <br> `run_routing`

   ![image](https://github.com/rinki89/Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning/blob/main/Pictures/Day5/11.png)
   
   If you've already prepared the _picorv32a design_ once before and want to run the prep command again, you need to add the _-overwrite_ option. This tells OpenLANE to reuse and update the existing run instead of showing an error. `prep -design picorv32a -tag 17-06_08-51` don‚Äôt need to use -overwrite because you're creating a new run directory. but when you using existing use -overwrite like `prep -design picorv32a -tag 16-06_16-56 overwrite`

   Command to load the routed def in magic tool <br> `magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.def &` <br>

3. Post-Route OpenSTA timing analysis with the extracted parasitics of the route. <br>
   The next step involves post-routing STA analysis, which requires the extraction of parasitic effects (SPEF).Since OpenLANE does not have a SPEF extraction tool, this process needs to     be done outside of OpenLANE.The resulting .spef file can be located in the routing folder under the results folder.
