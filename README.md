## Introduction
This project covers the full flow of VLSI SoC design using open-source tools such as OpenLane and Sky130 PDK.

## Software Installation
Instructions to install required tools like OpenLane, Magic, KLayout, etc.

## RTL Design
Designing UART and other modules in Verilog.

## Synthesis
Using Yosys to synthesize RTL to gate-level netlist.

## Floorplan & Placement
Physical layout steps using OpenLane.

## Routing
Final routing of interconnects using OpenROAD.

## Power Analysis
Estimation of power using RTL and gate-level tools.

## Conclusion
Summary of design outcomes, learnings, and improvements.
